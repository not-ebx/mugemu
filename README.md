# An Emulator for certain Mushroom-based Game.
This emulator was based on Swordie, but with a couple changes.
There are 2 main branches, the development branch which implements v111 and pre_bb dev which implements v92.
both versions are in a similar state, I would say that it's a pretty nice base if u wanna develop those versions.
It's not done at all, but I release it because I'm working on a new source from scratch in rust, which is more fun than java :)
